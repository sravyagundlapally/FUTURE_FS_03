# Glow Salon – Local Business Website

## Overview
This project is a professionally designed and developed website for a local beauty salon.
The goal of the website is to improve the salon’s online presence, build customer trust,
and make it easier for potential customers to connect with the business.

## Business Problem
The salon previously had no structured or professional online presence.
Customers had limited access to information such as available services, contact details,
and location, which reduced trust and online visibility.

## Solution
I designed and developed a clean, responsive, and user-friendly website that:
- Clearly showcases salon services
- Enables customers to contact the business via WhatsApp and a contact form
- Displays the business location using Google Maps
- Works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices

## Impact
This website helps the local business:
- Look more professional and trustworthy
- Attract new customers online
- Receive real customer inquiries through the contact form
- Improve visibility and accessibility in the local area

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Formspree (for contact form backend)
